## Movie Genre Classification Web Application

This Movie Genre Classification Web Application utilizes Machine Learning models served through an API to identify the genre of movies based on their descriptions. It provides users with an efficient tool to classify movie genres, enhancing their ability to organize and manage movie collections.

### Features:

1. **FastAPI Backend**: The backend of the application is implemented using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It exposes an endpoint `/predict` that accepts POST requests with movie description data and returns predictions.

2. **Streamlit Frontend**: The frontend of the application is implemented using Streamlit, a Python library that allows for the creation of customizable UI components for machine learning models. Users interact with the application through a user-friendly interface where they can input movie descriptions and receive predictions.

3. **Models**: The application leverages Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Balanced Random Forest models, utilizing powerful machine learning algorithms for genre classification.

### Usage:

- Users can run the application locally by executing the provided Python script.
- They can interact with the application through the Streamlit interface in their web browser, inputting movie descriptions and receiving predictions.
- The application provides predictions in real-time, leveraging machine learning models trained on historical movie data.

### Deployment:

- The application can be deployed locally or on a cloud platform using Docker. Docker containers encapsulate both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend, making deployment straightforward.
- Additionally, the application can be deployed to a serverless platform like Vercel or Heroku, leveraging their respective deployment methods.

### Future Improvements:

1. Enhance model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters or using more sophisticated models.
2. Add more features to improve prediction accuracy.

### Development:

- Developers can extend and enhance the application by adding new features, improving model accuracy, or optimizing performance.
- The codebase is modular and well-structured, facilitating easy maintenance and collaboration among developers.

Overall, this Movie Genre Classification application provides a practical solution for identifying movie genres, helping users organize and manage their movie collections effectively.
